An analysis of 130 wine reviews using Naive Bayes classifier and Vader Sentiment Analysis

Hi! Thank you for checking out my analysis of wine reviews from Wine Enthusiast Magazine (courtesy of Zack Thoutt's 2017 scrape of winemag.com).

Each jupyter notebook has the results printed to the screen. Just open up a notebook to see the results.

If you are interested in running your own analysis you can find the altered and changed dataset files here: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ybjsdpid0ym58lh/AACN30AtbpSeq9atIxlIvfMna?dl=0

1) Wine_Processing_SentimentAnalysis (f).ipynb contains my Text Blob Sentiment Analysis. I also performed a VADER sentiment analysis but visualized the results using tableau. If you would like the VADER analysis, please drop me an email.

2) Wine_Processing_SentimentAnalysis (f).ipynb contains my Naive Bayes classifier for the wine variety, "Pinot Noir". I was hoping to be able to classify the top 3 most reviewed wines, as each of them have around ~10k total reviews, but was limited by time.
